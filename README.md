### What I learned

As I am learning Javascript, this is my first small project to implement what I have learned. 

Applying an eventlistener to the form field to control the email input of the user, and working with the DOM to apply custom styles, and text. 

Aside from displaying a custom message when the email provided doesn't follow the correct format, I also thought it would be nice to add a custom border while the user is typing. 
While the input is wrong the border will remain red, as soon as it turns to the correct format, it will display green.

### Continued development

My main focus for now is Javascript.
